The main idea is making use of unique indexes for each node and leaf in a tree model,
exposed as a row with columns containing items of class QStandardItem.
This is an example of using a unique index for each row in the QStandardItemModel,
which belongs to each item of class MyStandardItem (for each column) of the row.
